# CSS Cleanup and Optimization Notes

## Redundant/Unused CSS Files to Remove
1. loading-responsive.css (merged into responsive.css)
2. screen-sizes.css (merged into responsive.css)
3. responsive-3d.css (merged into model-responsive.css)
4. guest-game-responsive.css (merge into model-responsive.css)

## CSS Files to Consolidate
1. base.css + accessibility.css -> base.css
2. game-interface-fixes.css + small-screen-fixes.css -> fixes.css 
3. model-*.css files into single model.css
4. responsive files into single responsive.css

## New CSS Structure
```
/styles
├── base.css           # Core styles + accessibility 
├── fixes.css         # All fixes and patches
├── model.css         # All 3D model related styles
├── responsive.css    # All responsive design rules

```
