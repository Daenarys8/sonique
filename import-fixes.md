# Import Verification Results

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. Environment Variable Naming:
   - Changed `VITE_APP_API_ENDPOINT` to `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` in leaderboardService.ts to match the correct environment variable name

2. Type Import Verification:
   - Confirmed UserProfile type imports in authService.ts and userService.ts match the type definition in types/game.ts
   - Verified Category type imports in useGameState.ts
   - Checked LeaderboardEntry type import in leaderboardService.ts

3. AWS Service Configuration:
   - Verified DynamoDB client configuration in config.ts
   - Confirmed AWS SDK imports are correct

4. Auth Service Dependencies:
   - Verified all Amplify auth imports are present and correct
   - Confirmed context provider imports match the service implementations

All critical import dependencies have been checked and verified. The system should now have consistent imports across all modules.
