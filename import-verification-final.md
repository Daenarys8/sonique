# Final Import Verification Results

## Updated Import Structure Changes

1. Sound Management:
   - ✅ Created dedicated `types/sound.ts` for sound-related type definitions
   - ✅ Updated LoadingPage.tsx to import SoundManager type from types/sound.ts
   - ✅ CategoryGrid.tsx now implements the SoundManager interface from types/sound.ts
   - ✅ Proper type/implementation separation maintained

2. Existing Fixed Imports:
   - ✅ Environment variable naming consistency (VITE_API_ENDPOINT)
   - ✅ AWS service configurations and imports
   - ✅ Type definitions and their usages
   - ✅ Context providers and hooks

3. File Structure Dependencies:
   - ✅ Components properly reference shared types
   - ✅ Relative paths updated to absolute where appropriate
   - ✅ No circular dependencies detected

All imports have been verified and are working correctly with the new file structure and type separation. The sound management implementation maintains proper separation of concerns between types and implementation.
