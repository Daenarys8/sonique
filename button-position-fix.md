# Button Position Analysis and Issues

## Current Implementation Issues

1. **StartPage Button Issues**:
- Buttons are positioned using absolute positioning (`absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`)
- This can cause layout issues on different screen sizes
- The flex column layout for buttons needs refinement
- Current positioning might overlap with other content

2. **LoadingPage Button Issues**:
- Button is nested within text-center div but lacks proper responsive positioning
- No specific mobile-friendly adjustments for button layout
- Spacing and margin adjustments needed for better visual hierarchy

## Required Fixes

1. **StartPage Changes Needed**:
- Remove absolute positioning for button container
- Use flex layout with proper spacing
- Add responsive padding and margin
- Implement proper vertical spacing between elements

2. **LoadingPage Changes Needed**:
- Add proper margin/padding for button spacing
- Implement responsive button size adjustments
- Add proper vertical spacing between elements
- Improve button container positioning

These issues need to be addressed to improve the button positioning and overall layout responsiveness of both pages.
