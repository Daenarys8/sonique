# Import Cleanup Changes

## Files and Imports Removed
1. Removed `loading-responsive.css` import from LoadingPage.tsx
   - This file was not found in the project
   - Responsive styles are already handled by the main responsive.css file
   - The loading page responsive styles are included in the base responsive.css with the following selectors:
     ```css
     .container, .category-grid-container, .puzzle-screen-container
     ```

## Verification
- ✅ Confirmed responsive.css contains necessary responsive styles
- ✅ Loading page layout remains responsive through existing styles
- ✅ No duplicate or conflicting responsive styles present
