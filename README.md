# SonIQue: Intergalactic IQ Game

## Overview

SonIQue is an interstellar game of intellect designed to challenge players' knowledge across various fields.

The game offers both guest and logged-in user experiences, with additional features and categories available for registered players.

## Features

- **Intergalactic Worlds:** Explore various worlds based on topics like science, history, and literature.
- **Dynamic IQs:** Tailored trivia questions generated with the help of AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock.
- **Guest Mode:** Play without needing to sign in.
- **Registered Users:** Access additional content, including different categories and challenges.
- **Voiceovers:** Engaging in-game voiceovers generated by Amazon Polly to immerse players in the story.
- **AI-generated Questions:** Trivia questions (IQs) dynamically generated for logged-in users.
