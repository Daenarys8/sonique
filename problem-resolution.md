# Category Clicking Issue Resolution

The issue with non-clickable categories has been fixed by:

1. Setting proper z-index values for the category grid (z-index: 1) and background elements (z-index: -1)
2. Changing background elements from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed` to ensure they don't interfere with click events
3. Adding proper positioning context with `position: relative` to the main container
4. Ensuring the main content area has a higher z-index (z-index: 10) than the background

These changes ensure that:
- Background elements stay behind the interactive elements
- Click events properly reach the category buttons
- Visual hierarchy is maintained
- The UI remains responsive and interactive

The categories should now be clickable while maintaining the desired visual design.
